## Conservation Group Meeting Speaker: Cllr Rachael Hogley: The Holme Valley Neighbourhood Plan 

Rachael has been chairing the group that has been formulating the Neighbourhood Plan on behalf of the Parish Council, part of the Planning framework for the area. The Draft Neighbourhood Plan has been a valuable document in understanding local approaches to policy and was a key component in drawing up a response to the Access Plan, published in March and now withdrawn. There are more details about this below.

## HOLMFIRTH TOWN CENTRE ACCESS PLAN - RESULTS OF PUBLIC CONSULTATION

After an unprecedented repsonse to the public consultation that ended on 5th April the scheme as presented has been shelved. Well done to all who took the time to make their feelings known - you were heard!

Below is some further information on the outcomes and rest assured we will be keeping a close eye on any new proposals that are forthcoming.

## Headline Results
Overall the majority of respondents did not agree that the preferred town centre access plan proposal would achieve the aims:
Four fifths of respondents disagreed (81.3%)
Out of this, the highest proportion strongly disagreed (61%)
Only around a tenth of respondents agreed (13%)
## Conclusion
Without the backing of local residents and businesses clearly there is no possibility of delivering the Holmfirth Town Centre Access Plan in its current format. Having listened to the issues raised at the engagement events, a different scheme which would still reduce journey times and increase capacity, alongside improvements to public realm and the aspirations of the Neighbourhood Plan is being developed. 
## Next Steps
As a result of the outcome of the public consultation Kirklees Council will reconsider the plans for Holmfirth. A revised scheme is being developed, informed by responses received. Revised plans will be published at the earliest opportunity.

## About Us In Brief
Last year we completed our Conservation Area Appraisal which can be found [here](/Appraisal/) 

A mammoth task to log and evaluate the current state of our beautiful town as Phase 1 of ensuring that we can keep it in the style to which we have all become accustomed.

One of our main goals post appraisal is to raise awareness of the conservation issues, large and small, which affect the town.
