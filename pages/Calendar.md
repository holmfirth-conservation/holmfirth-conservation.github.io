## FORTHCOMING EVENTS

A Public meeting will be held towards the end of November – public consultation where the community is invited to give its views.

HCG is in the process of planning two fund raising events.
1 Wine Tasting
2 Disco

Both to be held in January to raise much needed funds.  We need to find £2000.  If you can help, please let us know.
