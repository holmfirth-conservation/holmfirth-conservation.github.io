## FORTHCOMING EVENTS

18th October at 5pm meeting at The Old Bridge in the small area just inside the entrance..  Volunteers are urgently required to take part in a qualitative assessment of the Old Town area.  

The session will be led by Steve Davie, former planner and supported by Cathy Davie, former planner and Steve Ransby former planner.  What an opportunity….

They have produced an exciting format – cameras or phone cameras of course – as well as simple sheets for recording objects, views from points and your thoughts.  It will be a very different experience from the building survey and very sociable as you will be working in small groups.

Please send a message via the website.  We need you for this last part of surveying Holmfirth Conservation Area.


Committee meetings will be held on the last Tuesday of each month.

Any queries for the committee please contact us through the website.
