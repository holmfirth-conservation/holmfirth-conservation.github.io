## Who can become a Volunteer?

Holmfirth Conservation Group welcomes volunteers of all ages and abilities and will offer tailored training according to peopleâ€™s needs and interests.

Anybody aged 16 or over is welcome to become a volunteer. Those under 16 are welcome to attend a training event and carry out the role alongside an adult.

No previous experience is necessary as full training will be given and someone will be available to provide support should you need it.

## How do I become a Volunteer?

Firstly, we ask you to let us know by [email](mailto:Holmfirthconservation@outlook.com)  We will then contact you to discuss how you might become involved and ask you to complete an application form.  Once registered you will be ready to start! We will provide any training that may be required.
