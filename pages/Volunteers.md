## Who can become a Volunteer?

Holmfirth Conservation Group welcomes volunteers of all ages and abilities and will offer tailored training according to peopleâ€™s needs and interests.

Anybody aged 16 or over is welcome to become a volunteer. Those under 16 are welcome to attend a training event and carry out the role alongside an adult.

No previous experience is necessary as full training will be given and someone will be available to provide support should you need it.

## How do I become a Volunteer?

Firstly, we ask you to let us know by [email](mailto:Holmfirthconservation@outlook.com)  We will then contact you to discuss how you might become involved and ask you to complete an application form.  Once registered you will be ready to start! We will provide any training that may be required.

## What does the role involve?

During 2016 our voluteers have undertaken field surveys of the all the buildings in the Conservation Area, parks & open spaces, footpaths, trees and the River Holme as well as street surveys. 

We are now moving on to the next stage. Some of our volunteers have been writing up draft chapters for the appraisal which should be complete in February.  We now need to prepare for Public Consultation and are looking for voluteers to assist with stewarding and generally help out.

When the action points for the Management Plan have been agreed by members in the Spring of 2017, volunteers will form working parties once more in order to fulfill the community objectives.
