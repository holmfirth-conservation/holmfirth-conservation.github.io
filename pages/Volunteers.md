## What does the role involve?

You will play a vital role in the project, which aims to survey all buildings and open spaces within the conservation boundary of Holmfirth.  

The building survey involves a quick assessment of the condition of a building and an assessment of the authenticy of original features that remain today.

Each open space, roads, bridges, park, river has its own data sheet, which allows a rapid assessment of its condition.

## The task of a Survey Volunteer

Following training volunteers will be given the data sheets and a guidance manual and will work either individually or in small groups to conduct the survey. 

There is no minimum expectation of volunteers who register as survey volunteers. We understand that some will want to offer lots of time while others will need to fit their contribution in amongst other commitments. Any help you can offer will be gratefully received!

## Who can become a Survey Volunteer?

Holmfirth Conservation Group welcomes volunteers of all ages and abilities and will offer tailored training according to peopleâ€™s needs and interests.

Anybody aged 16 or over is welcome to become a volunteer surveyor. Those under 16 are welcome to attend a training event and carry out the role alongside an adult.

No previous experience is necessary as full training will be given and someone will be available to provide support should you need it.
