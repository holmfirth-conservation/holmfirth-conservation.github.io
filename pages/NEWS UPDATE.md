## UPDATE September 2017

The month commenced with the launch of our Discovery Trail launched by Jimmy Dickinson of Longley Farm and led by Deborah Wyles.

HCG received notification of a grant from Historic England’s Capacity Buildings Grant of £8500 towards the cost of the services of a conservation consultant and publication of the Conservation Area Appraisal.  HCG is most grateful for this generous grant and is currently searching for additional grant funding to ensure a successful conclusion.

Our Funding Event this month raised £250 towards our CAA project costs.  We thank Helen Bray for generously presenting photographs in her archives which celebrate 100 years of Bray’s Photographers.


## UPDATE October 2017

Members of the HCG Management Committee walked around the conservation area with Eddie Booth, Conservation Consultant of The Conservation Studio with whom we are now working.  Craig Broadwith of Historic England also joined us.  This occasions kick-started the process of review of the work to date.


## UPDATE July 2017

We have now interviewed three Heritage and Conservation Consultants and three Public Relation Consultants.  By Monday we should have agreed our preferred consultancies having met yesterday to discuss – it’s just the paperwork that is outstanding.

Our Funding Manager has almost completed our funding bid for a Capacity Building Grant which will be sent, once the timeline has been agreed, and, the consultancy selection has been made.  Once submitted we hope there will be a decision made about funding within six weeks.

The Editing Group has completed the first draft for review and endorsement by the Management Committee on the 2nd August which should just give enough time for adjustments to be made before the Draft Conservation Area Appraisal is passed to the Heritage and Conservation Consultant.

HCG will update as soon as there more news for you.


## UPDATE May 2017

On 24th April HCG met Cllr McBride who promised a letter of support for our work to date from Kirklees. 
The letter arrived at the start of May and Historic England have confirmed we now have all the necessary support we need to apply for funding from the Capacity Building Fund. The process of writing the briefs for conservation, design and Public Relations is under way.

Thank you to Donald Cumming and Helen Robinson who organised a Volunteering Fair at the Market Hall in Holmfirth on 13th May.  This gave us the opportunity to extend our volunteer base.  Four students from Holmfirth High School have expressed an interest in using Instagram to promote Holmfirth.  HCG has written to the Headteacher asking if this could be incorporated into the curriculum.  Mike Wade has offered to make a film accessed through a mobile phone with a QR code.  This will be an enhancement to our Interpretaion Board project lead by Deborah Wyles and supported by her skillful team.  Helen Bray, who this year is celebrating 100 years of the Bray family business, is making a presentation of old photographs.  She has kindly offered to present to our HCG membership - this will be a great oppportunity for the community to connect with old Holmfirth - always a winner.  Thank you to everyone who added their names to our list of volunteers.

## UPDATE March 2017

There was an open meeting on Tuesday 28th February at The Picturedrome to share the outcome of CA survey with surveyors , HCG members and interested parties.  90+ heads counted.  68 signed in.  Questionnaire handed out – 17 open-ended questions which will be analysed and form part of the basis of public opinion about the town.

£106 was raised for the interpretation board which will provide a tour with QR codes so that additional information can be accessed via mobile phone.

The Headteacher at Holmfirth High is keen for his students to be involved in future.

Letter of support not yet received from Kirklees but we will be meeting Cllr McBride this month (date to be advised), when we expect to receive our letter.

Kath Stewart and her Duke of Edinburgh Award students plan to clear two of our seven footpaths during April – thank you Kath and her team.

Kim Chandler our Events Manager with her team have organized the venue of our fund raising social evening – a quiz with supper at Holy Trinity Church Holmfirth on 28th April at 7:30pm.  More information to follow.


## UPDATE  February 2017

We had a good meeting with Kirklees Planning Department who were very impressed with HCG’s data on the built environment – in fact they were excited at what it could offer.  Simon Taylor and Nigel Hunston will be seeing the Planning Committee about the meeting.  We are hopeful that we will be given the long-awaited letter of support, hopefully before the end of the month.

Deborah Wyles and her team are very active planning the Interpretation Board which will lead residents and visitors young and old on a voyage of discovery around our heritage assets.  To date the project has received £1000 from One Community Fund – Longley Farm, £500 from Rotary.  An application for funding has been made to Holmfirth and Meltham Lions.  The project will cost more than we originally thought, so we will be looking for further funding.  If you have any ideas please let us know.
Kim Chandler’s Events Team are well underway with organizing the FREE open meeting at The Picuredrome on 28th February. Please come - there is no need to book. Although not essential it would help if you registered on [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/holmfirth-conservation-group-open-meeting-tickets-31534203652) to give us an idea of numbers. Our thanks go to Peter Carr and to the Holmfirth Film Festival who have supported us for the evening.  [Flyers](/files/Flyer 28 Feb v2 A5.docx) have been delivered to every commercial and professional service providers in Holmfirth and posters have been displayed about the town.  We are hoping for a good turnout for this event when we will be sharing our work to date and you will have the opportunity to share your views with us.

The Events Team are working on fund raising activities aimed at a wide audience – so watch this space.

Unfortunately, until we have the Kirklees letter of support, HCG cannot give a specific timescale but be assured we are not standing still, there’s still much to do.

## STOP PRESS! - Press release to celebrate the awarding of £1000 from the Longley Farm, Kirklees One Community Fund, released on 13th January 2015

Kirklees Fund and Holme Valley Parish Council support for ground-breaking community Heritage work in Holmfirth
Holmfirth Conservation Group (HCG), a community-based organisation established in 2015, has been awarded £1000 from the Longley Farm, Kirklees One Community Fund in recognition of their work in support of the Holmfirth Conservation Area. The money will help to pay for an interpretation board which will celebrate the cultural heritage of Holmfirth and lead residents and  visitors on a trail of discovery around Holmfirth.  
HCG has been working with a wide range of community groups, businesses and individuals, as well as the Holme Valley Parish Council, Holme Valley Ward Councillors and our local MP, Jason McCartney, who said “I am extremely impressed with the work you are doing.”    
Holme Valley Parish Council, in their letter of support for HCG (received 22 Dec 2016) said:
"Holme Valley Parish Council is both aware of and supportive of Holmfirth Conservation Group's plans to undertake a Conservation Area Appraisal of Holmfirth.
We are aware of the town's 'at risk' status as identified by Historic England in 2009 and expressed our concern to Kirklees Local Authority in January 2016 at the lack of Conservation Area Appraisal, which is their statutory duty to undertake. However, given the lack of resources within Kirklees to complete any appraisal and our desire to preserve our historic town, we welcomed the Holmfirth Conservation Group's work to prepare one and we provided grant funding earlier in the year to support this process".  
In addition the group has gained support from Councillor Andrew Cooper, Leader of the Green Party Group on Kirklees Council who said  
“ Congratulations to HCG for securing funding from One Community  to help improve and preserve the historic  buildings and environment in the town. As a Holme Valley resident myself I value the beauty of the area in both the quality of the local environment and the character of the buildings in Holmfirth Town Centre. The enthusiasm to protect our heritage is strong in local people and deserves supporting.” 
Thelma Walker (Labour Holme Valley South Ward 2016 election candidate) and Arthur Pritchard (Libdem 2016 election candidate)  have also added their support.
HCG’s members have been engaged in collecting data in the Holmfirth Conservation Area in order to provide a detailed picture of every aspect of the built environment. The group was approached by Historic England in August and encouraged to apply for a grant from their Capacity Building Fund. Currently, HCG is working on a draft of the Appraisal and discussing "ways forward" with Kirklees Councillors and Planning Officers in order to ensure that the grant application to History England is successful. Once funding is secured the HGC’s next step will be to engage conservation consultants to review the draft Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan.  Public meetings will be held to share the findings and to encourage community participation.   
HCG wishes to express their sincere thanks to Longley Farm One Community Fund, Holme Valley Parish Council and all those who are supporting the aims and work of the group
More information and details about the group can be found on their website www.holmfirthconservation.org.uk. 
These can also be found on Facebook.
