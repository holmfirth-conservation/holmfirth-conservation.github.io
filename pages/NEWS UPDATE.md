## UPDATE 21 JULY 2016

Yesterday Jenny Sweet and Anne met to discuss changes to our survey sheet for the River Holme.  Jenny will be making suggestions for changes which Clem will be updating.  

Thank you to our new band of volunteers who will be surveying the river.  Jenny will be leading a training day sometime towards the end of August.  Surveying of the river and its surroundings will begin in September.

## UPDATE 15 JULY

The first batches of completed data sheets are coming in.  Photographs have been taken of all the buildings in the zone we call “Cliff.” Each photo will be linked to the corresponding data form.  Modern technology is brilliant!  

This phase of the project will be a snapshot in time of our wonderful town and will in itself be an important historic record.

We have four areas within zones available for volunteers to put their names to.  If you have some free time, please get in touch.

We have a social evening coming up on 2nd August at 7pm at The Tap House in Holmfirth where volunteers can share their experiences.  It’s open to anyone - just let us know you’d like to come – you just need an interest in what we are doing.

We have found a Treasurer, thank you Jon

## UPDATE 29 JUNE

33 volunteers have been trained at the four training sessions run by HCG over 2 weeks during the month of June.


## Who are the Volunteers?

 Our recruits are all enthusiastic members of our community.  We are from a variety of backgrounds – town planning, landscape architecture,
 architecture, engineers, social scientists, educationalists, local politic backgrounds, IT, heritage and tourism, 
 commerce and “Kim” who loves data.  

Our team of former town planners is surveying the “old town” which dates mainly from the early 19th Century, contains most listed building, is the commercial heart  and is therefore a key area of the town.

## Involving young people

We are delighted that a group of young people known as “The Hit Squad” will survey Victoria Park.  They are a group of 14-19 year olds working for their Duke of Edinburgh Awards.  We look forward to receiving their work and talking to them about their perceptions and sharing it with you.  We know that young voices count in Holmfirth and will be using their work to advance their vision.

## What brings us together?  

Well, first and foremost a love of our town and a desire to consider it as it is in 2016 and where we want it to be in the future.  We will be providing a snapshot in time!

## How we set about the task

Having divided each area into reasonably sized chunks of 20-25 buildings, in general, we have set our volunteers to work.

They are now active in the field working firstly on buildings before progressing to open spaces, Victoria Park, roads, carparks, street furniture, trees – in fact everything classed as the public realm.
