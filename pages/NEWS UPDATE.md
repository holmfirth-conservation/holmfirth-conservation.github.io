## UPDATE December 2016


HCG has been awarded £1000 by Longley Farm, One Community Fund that will go towards an information board to direct visitors around some of the historic sites in Holmfirth.  We are so grateful for this support and for the recognition of all the hard work put into this community venture by so many of you.  Thank you Longley Farm, One Community Fund

Data collection is almost complete.  Great work by our surveyors working on the street scene which Steve Davie, a former town planner has found inspiring.  He has completed the draft for the street scene in the Old Town.

[Jenny Sweet](https://www.sweetlandscapedesign.co.uk) has analysed the data collected by 14 volunteers and has completed her draft chapter on the character of the River Holme as it flows through Holmfirth.  How lucky we are to have her expertise as a Landscape Architect to complete this task for us

A letter of support for our work has come in from Jason McCartney MP.

We have received emails congratulating us on our award and supporting our work from Thelma Walker HVS Labour candidate 2016 and Arthur Pritchard HVS Lib-Dem candidate for 2016.  It’s good to know they are still maintaining their interest in the valley.

Andrew Cooper Leader of The Green Party in Kirklees has also sent an email of congratulations.  Charles Fairbank Co-ordinator of the Green’s in the Colne Valley has offered to provide support when we need help with a task

Historic England has asked HCG to help Keynsham, North East Somerset Community Conservation Area Survey.

It is so good to know that attention to our project is spreading and inspiring so many people and groups.  Thank you everyone for recognizing the value of community engagement in many aspects that in the past would have been completed and paid for from local government.

We meet with Kirklees Planning Department on 11th January 2017 to share our progress.

*******************************

## UPDATE November 2016

Historic England require letters of confirmation of broad support for the project from Kirklees and our ward councilors before they consider our application from grant funding.

Kirklees have asked to see our technical data.  We have requested a meeting where we can share it with them but as yet have received no reply.

Requested a letter of confirmation of their support from our ward councilors, Cllr Nigel Patrick, Cllr Ken Sims and Cllr Donald Firth as yet not received but we are hopeful of a positive response.

Editing team have started collecting our preparatory chapters and assuming our application for grant funding from HE is successful chapter writers and the editing team will be consulting with the conservation specialists to ensure our work meets required standards.

Almost all the data collection has been submitted – 

When it has all been received the Streetscape of Holmfirth and the shop frontages will be analysed and descriptive chapters written by two of our former planners.

Draft application for grant funding sent to Historic England and their comments have been received and the application will be amended to reflect their comments


SCHEDULE

This will need to be revised because
•	Application won’t be ready until early December (Management Committee meet 6th December to finalise).
•	Awaiting letters of support to accompany the application.
•	Consideration for grant funding takes 4-6 weeks, with Christmas intervening,  a delay is inevitable.

Please note a revised schedule will be posted in December.

The Editing Team are:

Peter Hibbard, 
Frances Bennett, 
Deborah Wyles, 
Stephen Baggott, 
Clem Bacon, 

Profiles have been posted for all, with the exception of Frances Bennett who is a geologist who has a wealth of experience in report writing.

## UPDATE 4 September

On the 30th August – 10 Volunteers were trained by our volunteer Landscape Architect - [Jenny Sweet](https://www.sweetlandscapedesign.co.uk), to survey the condition of the surroundings and banks of the River Holme as it courses through the conservation area.  The meeting was attended by Kim Warren of River 2015, thank you Kim.  The survey is underway!

50% of the data from the buildings survey has been entered into our spreadsheet, thanks to Carol Ripley, Michael Martin, Frances Bennett and Clem Bacon.  Thanks to our volunteer surveyors and photographers for making this survey so successful.

The Committee will be talking to conservation and heritage consultants on the 20th September about our writing of the Appraisal and Management Plan and the guidance they might be able to offer.

We have the names of 15 volunteers who will be helping to survey the public realm this month which we hope will be completed mid October

*********************************************

## UPDATE 18 August

Ten volunteer surveyors were joined by Jason McCartney, and his colleague John, to conduct a team survey of the buildings in the Hollowgate area.

We started at Longley’s café where a party atmosphere prevailed.  Jason gained  an insight into how we collect the data.  Each volunteer had the opportunity to talk directly to him about their interest in the project, to share their experiences and just talk about the project.

Jason supports the project and is excited about the opportunities for conservation and enhancement of our town.

We hope to establish a complementary role to Kirklees, Holme Valley Parish Council and our Ward Councillors to safeguard our heritage.

**********************************************************

## UPDATE 16 August

This week has been a particularly exciting one.  

On the 14th July we were contacted by Craig Broadwith of Historic England with a suggestion of possible funding to ensure the Appraisal of Holmfirth Conservation Area and Management Plan could reach a positive conclusion.  

Next July Historic England will be celebrating 50 years of The Civic Amenities Act.  To mark this landmark occasion the organization has selected the HCG as a candidate for funding because our community led project is a national rarity.  

If we are successful in our bid exciting possibilities for the future of Holmfirth as a national focus could increase tourism in our valley.

Watch this space for any updates.

****************************************************

## UPDATE 21 JULY

Yesterday Jenny Sweet and Anne met to discuss changes to our survey sheet for the River Holme.  Jenny will be making suggestions for changes which Clem will be updating.  

Thank you to our new band of volunteers who will be surveying the river.  Jenny will be leading a training day sometime towards the end of August.  Surveying of the river and its surroundings will begin in September.

******************************************************

## UPDATE 15 JULY

The first batches of completed data sheets are coming in.  Photographs have been taken of all the buildings in the zone we call “Cliff.” Each photo will be linked to the corresponding data form.  Modern technology is brilliant!  

This phase of the project will be a snapshot in time of our wonderful town and will in itself be an important historic record.

We have four areas within zones available for volunteers to put their names to.  If you have some free time, please get in touch.

We have a social evening coming up on 2nd August at 7pm at The Tap House in Holmfirth where volunteers can share their experiences.  It’s open to anyone - just let us know you’d like to come – you just need an interest in what we are doing.

We have found a Treasurer, thank you Jon

*******************************************************

## UPDATE 29 JUNE

33 volunteers have been trained at the four training sessions run by HCG over 2 weeks during the month of June.


## Who are the Volunteers?

 Our recruits are all enthusiastic members of our community.  We are from a variety of backgrounds – town planning, landscape architecture,
 architecture, engineers, social scientists, educationalists, local politic backgrounds, IT, heritage and tourism, 
 commerce and “Kim” who loves data.  

Our team of former town planners is surveying the “old town” which dates mainly from the early 19th Century, contains most listed building, is the commercial heart  and is therefore a key area of the town.

## Involving young people

We are delighted that a group of young people known as “The Hit Squad” will survey Victoria Park.  They are a group of 14-19 year olds working for their Duke of Edinburgh Awards.  We look forward to receiving their work and talking to them about their perceptions and sharing it with you.  We know that young voices count in Holmfirth and will be using their work to advance their vision.

## What brings us together?  

Well, first and foremost a love of our town and a desire to consider it as it is in 2016 and where we want it to be in the future.  We will be providing a snapshot in time!

## How we set about the task

Having divided each area into reasonably sized chunks of 20-25 buildings, in general, we have set our volunteers to work.

They are now active in the field working firstly on buildings before progressing to open spaces, Victoria Park, roads, carparks, street furniture, trees – in fact everything classed as the public realm.
