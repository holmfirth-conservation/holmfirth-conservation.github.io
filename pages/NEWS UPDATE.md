## STOP PRESS! - Press release to celebrate the awarding of £1000 from the Longley Farm, Kirklees One Community Fund, released on 13th January 2015

Kirklees Fund and Holme Valley Parish Council support for ground-breaking community Heritage work in Holmfirth
Holmfirth Conservation Group (HCG), a community-based organisation established in 2015, has been awarded £1000 from the Longley Farm, Kirklees One Community Fund in recognition of their work in support of the Holmfirth Conservation Area. The money will help to pay for an interpretation board which will celebrate the cultural heritage of Holmfirth and lead residents and  visitors on a trail of discovery around Holmfirth.  
HCG has been working with a wide range of community groups, businesses and individuals, as well as the Holme Valley Parish Council, Holme Valley Ward Councillors and our local MP, Jason McCartney, who said “I am extremely impressed with the work you are doing.”    
Holme Valley Parish Council, in their letter of support for HCG (received 22 Dec 2016) said:
"Holme Valley Parish Council is both aware of and supportive of Holmfirth Conservation Group's plans to undertake a Conservation Area Appraisal of Holmfirth.
We are aware of the town's 'at risk' status as identified by Historic England in 2009 and expressed our concern to Kirklees Local Authority in January 2016 at the lack of Conservation Area Appraisal, which is their statutory duty to undertake. However, given the lack of resources within Kirklees to complete any appraisal and our desire to preserve our historic town, we welcomed the Holmfirth Conservation Group's work to prepare one and we provided grant funding earlier in the year to support this process".  
In addition the group has gained support from Councillor Andrew Cooper, Leader of the Green Party Group on Kirklees Council who said  
“ Congratulations to HCG for securing funding from One Community  to help improve and preserve the historic  buildings and environment in the town. As a Holme Valley resident myself I value the beauty of the area in both the quality of the local environment and the character of the buildings in Holmfirth Town Centre. The enthusiasm to protect our heritage is strong in local people and deserves supporting.” 
Thelma Walker (Labour Holme Valley South Ward 2016 election candidate) and Arthur Pritchard (Libdem 2016 election candidate)  have also added their support.
HCG’s members have been engaged in collecting data in the Holmfirth Conservation Area in order to provide a detailed picture of every aspect of the built environment. The group was approached by Historic England in August and encouraged to apply for a grant from their Capacity Building Fund. Currently, HCG is working on a draft of the Appraisal and discussing "ways forward" with Kirklees Councillors and Planning Officers in order to ensure that the grant application to History England is successful. Once funding is secured the HGC’s next step will be to engage conservation consultants to review the draft Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan.  Public meetings will be held to share the findings and to encourage community participation.   
HCG wishes to express their sincere thanks to Longley Farm One Community Fund, Holme Valley Parish Council and all those who are supporting the aims and work of the group
More information and details about the group can be found on their website www.holmfirthconservation.org.uk. 
These can also be found on Facebook.

*********************************************

## UPDATE 18 August

Ten volunteer surveyors were joined by Jason McCartney, and his colleague John, to conduct a team survey of the buildings in the Hollowgate area.

We started at Longley’s café where a party atmosphere prevailed.  Jason gained  an insight into how we collect the data.  Each volunteer had the opportunity to talk directly to him about their interest in the project, to share their experiences and just talk about the project.

Jason supports the project and is excited about the opportunities for conservation and enhancement of our town.

We hope to establish a complementary role to Kirklees, Holme Valley Parish Council and our Ward Councillors to safeguard our heritage.

**********************************************************

## UPDATE 16 August

This week has been a particularly exciting one.  

On the 14th July we were contacted by Craig Broadwith of Historic England with a suggestion of possible funding to ensure the Appraisal of Holmfirth Conservation Area and Management Plan could reach a positive conclusion.  

Next July Historic England will be celebrating 50 years of The Civic Amenities Act.  To mark this landmark occasion the organization has selected the HCG as a candidate for funding because our community led project is a national rarity.  

If we are successful in our bid exciting possibilities for the future of Holmfirth as a national focus could increase tourism in our valley.

Watch this space for any updates.

****************************************************

## UPDATE 21 JULY

Yesterday Jenny Sweet and Anne met to discuss changes to our survey sheet for the River Holme.  Jenny will be making suggestions for changes which Clem will be updating.  

Thank you to our new band of volunteers who will be surveying the river.  Jenny will be leading a training day sometime towards the end of August.  Surveying of the river and its surroundings will begin in September.

******************************************************

## UPDATE 15 JULY

The first batches of completed data sheets are coming in.  Photographs have been taken of all the buildings in the zone we call “Cliff.” Each photo will be linked to the corresponding data form.  Modern technology is brilliant!  

This phase of the project will be a snapshot in time of our wonderful town and will in itself be an important historic record.

We have four areas within zones available for volunteers to put their names to.  If you have some free time, please get in touch.

We have a social evening coming up on 2nd August at 7pm at The Tap House in Holmfirth where volunteers can share their experiences.  It’s open to anyone - just let us know you’d like to come – you just need an interest in what we are doing.

We have found a Treasurer, thank you Jon

*******************************************************

## UPDATE 29 JUNE

33 volunteers have been trained at the four training sessions run by HCG over 2 weeks during the month of June.


## Who are the Volunteers?

 Our recruits are all enthusiastic members of our community.  We are from a variety of backgrounds – town planning, landscape architecture,
 architecture, engineers, social scientists, educationalists, local politic backgrounds, IT, heritage and tourism, 
 commerce and “Kim” who loves data.  

Our team of former town planners is surveying the “old town” which dates mainly from the early 19th Century, contains most listed building, is the commercial heart  and is therefore a key area of the town.

## Involving young people

We are delighted that a group of young people known as “The Hit Squad” will survey Victoria Park.  They are a group of 14-19 year olds working for their Duke of Edinburgh Awards.  We look forward to receiving their work and talking to them about their perceptions and sharing it with you.  We know that young voices count in Holmfirth and will be using their work to advance their vision.

## What brings us together?  

Well, first and foremost a love of our town and a desire to consider it as it is in 2016 and where we want it to be in the future.  We will be providing a snapshot in time!

## How we set about the task

Having divided each area into reasonably sized chunks of 20-25 buildings, in general, we have set our volunteers to work.

They are now active in the field working firstly on buildings before progressing to open spaces, Victoria Park, roads, carparks, street furniture, trees – in fact everything classed as the public realm.
