* Holmfirth’s magnificent valley once set the scene for a thriving woollen textile industry. Today, a wealth of well-preserved Georgian buildings, characteristic under and over dwellings and weavers’ cottages with rows of tall mullioned windows, stand as testament to Holmfirth’s past and provide the setting for its emergence as a lively centre for the arts, culture and tourism. Explore Holmfirth’s eventful history and proud heritage on this fascinating trail through the heart of the town.
