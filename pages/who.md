## Who are we

We are currently a team of five people with different skills and experiences ranging from land science, strategic planning , history and education who came together as a group with the aim of working as a community to conduct an appraisal to preserve and enhance our conservation area.

## Our constitution

The group was formally constituted in February 2016 but we are currently considering becoming a CIO.  We intend to widen our membership so that anyone or any group with an interest in Holmfirth can become members with voting rights on the trustees/committee members and decisions made at AGM.

## Partnership

Holmfirth Conservation Group (HCG) is committed to involving  all groups and interested parties.  We currently work closely with Holme Valley Vision (HVV), River 2015, HEAD (local business association) and Keep Holmfirth Special.  We will be working with a Duke of Edinburgh Award group based at Honley High School and we wish to extend to other adult and youth groups in the town.

HCG believes that community involvement is the most powerful tool we have to conserve and enhance our town.

We are committed to good communication with all interested parties and we constantly look at new ways of reaching out so that the group is representative of the wider community.  To this end, we have regular newsletters, a facebook page and a newly built website which will be regularly updated to reflect the work and aspirations of the town.

Holme Valley Parish Council is currently working on its statutory duty to write a Local Neighbourhood Plan.  HCG is working closely with the Parish Council – two parish councillors are part of the team – and our data will be used to inform the Neighbourhood Plan.  HCG along with other groups in Holmfirth are members of the steering group for the Neighbourhood Plan but HCG is a group in its own right totally independent of the Parish Council.

## Community Involvement

This is essential to ensure an effective successful outome.  Trustees, members and volunteers will work together to conduct the survey and decide on the points of action which make the management plan.  There will be regular open meetings to report and to obtain the community’s views of progress and strategy

At the present moment we rely on the goodwill of individuals and groups.  Besides what the team contributes, experts in their fields are advising on design of forms, free GIS software (essential for displaying data in layered graphical form which is easy to read and inform).  We have a consultant providing work free of charge which includes interactive web site and GIS expertise. HEAD and Keep Holmfirth Special have generously  provided us with funds so that we are able to hold our open meetings.

We are currently looking for funds by applying to local companies and Heritage Lottery Fund to cover other costs of conducting the appraisal
