## Who are we

We are now a committee of ten people with different skills and experiences ranging from land science, strategic planning , history, education,architecture and town planning who came together as a group with the aim of working with the community to conduct an appraisal to preserve and enhance our conservation area. The officers of the committee are CHAIRPERSON: Anne Bacon,  SECRETARY: Deborah Wyles,  and TREASURER: Jon Green. You can read their profiles and other committee member profiles [here](/files/Committeebiographies4.pdf)

## Our constitution

The group was formally [constituted](/files/HCGconstitution.pdf) in February 2016 band is currently applying to become a CIO (Charitable Incorporated Organisation).  We have widened our membership so that anyone or any group with an interest in Holmfirth can become members with voting rights on the proceedures of the group. We currently have 41 members.

## Partnership

Holmfirth Conservation Group (HCG) is committed to involving  all groups and interested parties.  We currently work closely with Holme Valley Vision (HVV), [River 2015](http://river2015.org/rwp/), [HEAD](http://www.holmfirthhead.co.uk) (local business association) and Keep Holmfirth Special.  We are working with a Duke of Edinburgh Award group based at Honley High School and we wish to extend to other adult and youth groups in the town.

HCG believes that community involvement is the most powerful tool we have to preserve and enhance our town.

We are committed to good communication with all interested parties and we constantly look at new ways of reaching out so that the group is representative of the wider community.  To this end, we have regular newsletters, [a facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/holmfirthconservation) and this website which will be regularly updated to reflect the work and progress.

It is our intention to share our experience in conducting a survey and completing a conservation appraisal with all the other conservation areas in the Holme Valley to enable them to go through the same process.

[Holme Valley Parish Council](http://www.holmevalleyparishcouncil.gov.uk) is currently working on its statutory duty to write a Local Neighbourhood Plan.  HCG is working closely with the Parish Council – two parish councillors are part of the team – and our data will be used to inform the Neighbourhood Plan.  HCG along with other groups in Holmfirth are members of the steering group for the Neighbourhood Plan. [Kirklees Conservation and Design](http://www.kirklees.gov.uk/business/conservation/index.aspx) section of their website is a helpful resource in informing the Neighbourhood Plan project.

## Community Involvement

This is essential to ensure an effective successful outcome.  Trustees, members and volunteers will work together to conduct the survey and decide on the points of action for the management plan.  There will be regular open meetings to report and to obtain the community’s views of progress and strategy.

At the present moment we rely on the goodwill of individuals and groups.  Besides what the team contributes, experts and consultants in their fields have advised on design of survey forms, the use GIS software (essential for displaying data in layered graphical form which is easy to read and inform) and the development of an interactive website. HEAD ((Holmfirth Enterprise and Development) and Keep Holmfirth Special have generously provided us with funds to enable us to hold our open meetings.

We are currently looking for grants and funds by applying to local companies.
