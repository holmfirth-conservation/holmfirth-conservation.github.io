## Why is the community conducting the appraisal itself?


* Although protecting the unique characteristics of a conservation area is enshrined in the defined duties of LA’s by central government, and is overseen by [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/planning/conservation-areas/) – Kirklees Council do not the resources to conduct an appraisal at this time.
* The historic significance of the town is gradually being eroded. Indeed,in 2009 Holmfirth was designated a conservation area "At risk" by Historic England
* A conservation appraisal of Holmfirth will provide a greater focus on planning applications to ensure conservation objectives are met. 
* The power of the community working together to produce the appraisal and management plan with a shared understanding of what we value and how we want Holmfirth to develop.

## What are the implications for a property owner?

* There are development controls which are often ignored by owners who don’t know they live in a conservation area or they choose to ignore it, and by Kirklees because they don’t have an appraisal to inform them or the resources to enforce it.


## What are the advantages?

* The contents of the appraisal will have to be considered any future planning applications
* The community of Holmfirth will have a shared understanding of its conservation area and its obligations to preserve and enhance it.
* The community of Holmfirth will have worked together to produce a management plan to preserve and enhance Holmfirth's heretage.
* Holmfirth Conservation Town will be able to apply for funding to realize its aims and objectives.
