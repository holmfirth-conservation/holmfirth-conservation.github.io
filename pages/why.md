## Why is the community conducting the appraisal itself?

* Principally because Kirklees does not have the resources
* Although protecting the unique characteristics of a conservation area is enshrined in defined duties of LA’s by central government, and is overseen by Historic England – these requirements are frequently ignored.
* The historic significance of the town is gradually being eroded because of poor planning decisions.
* Kirklees will have to take notice of an appraisal of Holmfirth whenever considering planning applications.
* The power of the community working together to produce the appraisal and management plan with a shared understanding of what we value and how we want Holmfirth to develop will be a powerful tool which cannot be ignored.

## What are the implications for a property owner?

* There are development controls which are often ignored by owners who don’t know they live in a conservation area or they choose to ignore it, and by Kirklees because they don’t have an appraisal to inform them or the resources to enforce it.
* These controls need reviewing, it might be in the form of encouragement to replace uPVC windows with wooden ones when considering replacement or could be acceptance of uPVC but in the heritage style of the areas architecture. That will be decided by the community.

## What are the advantages?

* Kirklees will have to consider the contents of the appraisal when considering any future planning applications
* The community of Holmfirth will have a shared understanding of its conservation area and its obligations to preserve and enhance it.
* The community of Holmfirth will have worked together to produce a management plan to preserve and enhance
* Holmfirth Conservation Town will be able to apply for funding to realize its aims and objectives.
