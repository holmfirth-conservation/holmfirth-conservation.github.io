## The survey

* We now have all the completed building survey forms.  All the data has been entered into the database.  The survey of the public realm has been completed.
* Each building has been photographed and given a unique reference
* The survey was designed to be quick and easy to use by the surveyor, and easily accessible by the data input team
* The survey has two parts – a condition survey which records the present condition of the building, highlighting areas of concern and an architectural authenticity survey that idenifies those characteristics that most truthfully reflect and embody the cultural heritage values of Holmfirth.
* All buildings and monuments with grade II listing have been measured against the criteria for which they were listed.
* The Public Realm has also been surveyed, including street furniture, signage, lighting, waste bins as well as parks and open spaces


## Data Analysis
* Googlesheets have been used to input and store data from the survey forms.There are 50,000 data entries. 
* The analysis and the interpretation will be presented to a series of public meetings
* The Appraisal and Management plan will be available to the Parish Council, for inclusion in the  The Neighbourhood Plan for The Holme Valley

## Public Consultation
* The public’s views have been collected from the meetings and from questionnaires and action points which will be prioritized by the community and members

* Holmfirth Conservation Group is willing to share its findings, experiences and assist other community groups engaged in Conservation Area Appraisals subject to licensing terms which can be viewed from the link at the bottom of each web page.
* Public Consultation Meeting was held on 22nd November at The Old Bridge Inn, Holmfirth. The public’s views will inform the  draft CAA which will be sent to Kirklees for comment before the CAA is completed.  Kirklees should use the issues to produce a Management Plan for Holmfirth.  Internal investment in the town should lead to greater prosperity in the town, more local jobs, preservation of the historic buildings which represent more than 80% of Holmfirth’s built environment and enhancement of the public realm to boost the special interest of our Conservation Town and the Holme Valley.
