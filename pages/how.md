## The survey

Click [here](#) to see an example of the buildings survey form.

* Each building will be photographed and given a unique reference
* The survey is designed to be quick and easy to use by the surveyor, and easily accessible by the data input team
* The survey has two parts – a condition survey which is a major threat to heritage and an authenticity survey which measures the extent of original features.
* All buildings and monuments with grade II listing will be measured against the criteria for which they were listed.
* The team will be using googlesheets, which is free software designed so that two or more people can update at the same time and see the all the work being input at the same time.
* Googlesheets is stored in the cloud, and is regarded secure data.
* Layers of information can be extracted and added to GIS software, eg trees with TPO’s, building use, building condition, authenticity of original features, buildings with a positive, neutral or negative impact on the conservation area, vistas and Grade II listed buildings and monuments with a précis of their listing and links to the Historic England site where full details are available.

## Data Analysis
* The data itself and the GIS software will provide the analysis
* The analysis and the interpretation will be presented to the community at a public meeting
* All data will be available to the Parish Council, so that it can be included in The Neighbourhood Plan for The Holme Valley

# Informing the Process

Extensive research which involved visits and meetings with Hebden Bridge Partnership whose history goes back to the 1960’s but with a wide membership and grant funding has achieved great things in conserving and enhancing the town and beyond has been an inspiration to the group to press on in the face of many dead-ends.

We have studied conservation appraisals on line published by different authorities including a number undertaken by Kirklees and research the guidance given by Historic England.

A number of heritage organisations have been consulted incluing Maintain Our Heritage who have been particularly helpful when it has come to the threats to features of historic buildings.

Bradford City Council were particularly helpful in sharing with us how they conducted an appraisal which recorded the authenticity of original features.  We will be using the same methods for the authenticity survey.

With regards to digital mapping – we have consulted an international consultant who has had a remit for displaying data in digital format to inform the G8 summit and to enhance freedom of information for central government  and public worldwide.  This consultant is kindly using GIS mapping software on our behalf and developing and hosting an interactive website for HCG.

As a result of his experiences we have the data for trees with a TPO which includes the species which has been entered onto GIS system saving a great deal of time on identification and mapping.

Now that we have the endorsement of Historic England and Kirklees Planning Department of our survey forms we are ready to proceed.
