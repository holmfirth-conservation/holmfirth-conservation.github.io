THE DRAFT CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL IS NOW AVAILABLE TO VIEW

## NOTE
* This is the HCG's first draft of the Holmfirth Conservation Area Appraisal (CAA)

* No design has been applied as it is still a working document until stakeholders have had time to comment.

* It is intended that the draft CAA is read with the associated evidence in the appendices.

If you have any comments please [email](mailto:Holmfirthconservation@outlook.com) no later than 5th February 2018. Your comments will inform the final version
