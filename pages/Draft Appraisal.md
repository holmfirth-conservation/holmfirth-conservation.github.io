The Draft Conservation Appraisal and supporting appendices will be put on the website on Friday 19th January

## NOTE
This is the HCG's first draft of the Holmfirth Conservation Area Appraisal (CAA)

No design has been applied as it is still a working docment until stakeholders have had time to comment.

It is intended that the draft CAA is read with the associated evidence in the appendices.

If you have ant comments please [email](mailto:Holmfirthconservation@outlook.com) no later than 5th February 2018. Your comments will inform the final version
